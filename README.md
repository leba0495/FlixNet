### Notes
This part 2 of the flix app was very insightful because it allowed to learn the many feature you can add to your app with just some basic and simple code or settings. I spent a lot of time try to get the image poster to display correctly on the Movie Feed. I believe the way I had set up my stackviews was not allowing me to set up the prototype cell's content to display how I wanted it. Also, when it came to abjust the grid layout on the collection view, I tried to do it on the interface builder through the inspectors but it resulted so much easier to follow along the video. I still need to dive deeper into collection views to understand the layout better like the inter item spacing. Overall, it was a good learning experience and I hope to tackle the bonus challenges soon.

### Notes
I had some issues dealing with Step 4, installing the CocoaPods, and getting the commands to work corrently. To solve it, I installed CocoaPods using HomeBrew and that seemed to solve the issue with the commands. I believe that CocoaPods was not installed on my machine or I didn't know how to access it properly.
Besides that, no other major challanges for this part of the project except when it came to running the app on my device. I thought the process would be more straight forward. After, playing around with some sing in settings and making sure my apple ID were set up correctly, everything worked as expected.
